From initial power it goes to a "Waiting to begin state" Pressing play/pause begins the round at starts the score.

Four possibilites:
Pressing PLAY/PAUSE again will stop polling the pins and change the LEDs to blue. Here you can use the buttons to reset any indivual pin if they were incorrectly knocked over. No need to be concerned about making score adjustments later
Pressing END ROUND moves it to the "waiting to reset" stage, ending polling and waiting for a "RESUME" input to reset the pins
If all of one teams pins are knocked over the round will end and move to the "waiting to reset stage" which works as stated above
If time runs out once again we move to the "waiting to reset" stage

At "waiting to reset" you have to press resume to start the reset. If the screen shows -1 just hit resume again.

"Adjust score" state lets you change teh score with labelebed buttons on the control box. Hitting resume lets you leave that state. This takes you back to "Waiting to begin"

Any unsual behavior can usually be rectified by turning the system off and then restoring power. I recomend driving all the power for the control system on the same extension cord with a switch for ease of use.
