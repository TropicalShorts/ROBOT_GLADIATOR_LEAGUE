Make it so after a team has knocked 3 pins the other pins no longer color change on a knock

Change the code so it doesn't reset pins that haven't gone down and optimizes to put up only the ones which have in a timely manner. Possible issues with pins being knocked but not registered and then not getting reset because of optimization

Adding an additional proximity sensor to provide more accurate pin falling readings and help elimnate pins eing knocked not registering
