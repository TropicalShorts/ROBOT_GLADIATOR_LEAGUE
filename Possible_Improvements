Make it so after a team has knocked 3 pins the other pins no longer color change on a knock. Could possibly be done in state 3 with some additional messaging from the Mega to nanos. Nanos would require another state.

Change the code so it doesn't reset pins that haven't gone down and optimizes to put up only the ones which have in a timely manner. Possible issues with pins being knocked but not registered and then not getting reset because of optimization

Adding an additional proximity sensor to provide more accurate pin falling readings and help eliminate pins being knocked not registering

Adding MIDI communications to automate lights and sounds. Can be done with a MIDI connector as shown here (also a good resource regardless) or with some more complexity over bluetooth using a device such as an ESP32
